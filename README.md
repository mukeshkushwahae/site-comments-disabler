## Site Comments Disabler

This is a **Must-Use (MU) plugin** for WordPress that **completely disables comments** across your whole site. It removes all comment features from the frontend and backend, including:

- No comment boxes on posts or pages
- No "Comments" menu in the admin dashboard
- No "Discussion" settings in admin
- Removes support for comments and trackbacks from all post types
- Hides comment-related HTML like `<div class="comments-area">`
- Blocks comment and ping functions using filters


## What is an MU Plugin?

MU stands for **Must-Use**. MU plugins are loaded automatically by WordPress and don’t show up in the regular Plugins screen. They’re good for **site-wide or permanent functionality**.

## Why use this plugin?

If your website doesn’t need comments (like a company site, landing page, or static blog), this plugin helps you **clean everything** related to WordPress comments with zero configuration.


## How to install

1. Go to your WordPress directory.
2. Open the `wp-content/mu-plugins/` folder.
3. If the `mu-plugins` folder doesn’t exist, create it.
4. Copy the file `site-comments-disabler.php` into this folder.

That’s it! WordPress will load the plugin automatically. No need to activate it — MU plugins run by default.
